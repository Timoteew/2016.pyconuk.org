I am at present a Mathematics student at Cardiff University, going into my second year. Having looked at python in no real depth prior to the course it was not until the first semester that I had a proper introduction to the basics of the language. As part of my research into the maths of RSA I explored the behaviour of Euler's "totient function" and was aided greatly by python in explaining the striking patterns which arose.
